# COLLECTIONS

- Collections are dynamic
- Collections have methods to add, subtract, filter, etc.
- Arrays not dynamic - do not have methods, can't change size of array but have to create new array.

## Lists:
- V similar to arrays in terms of functionality
- store strings, numbers, objects
- iterate over them or pass them around from method to method
- storing objects in order - main distinction of list compared to other types of collections
- List is an interface - so have to create implementation of class that implements the interface
- LinkedList and ArrayList - arrayList most popular - most devs go for arrayList to store generic collection of objects
- ArrayList uses an actual array - difference, array you have to initialise its size on creation and then cant change it's size
- List can grow or shrink dynaically as needed
- Lists can only hold objects not primtives - arrays can be ysed to tore primtiives, Lists cannot, have to store actual objects - not big deal, can just wrap objects in primtive wrapper -classes - though this is more heavy weight
- should genereally prefer to store object instances in a more generic type, or to store object instances in interfaces, i.e. List arrayList = new ArrayList(); not ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();
- typical pattern : in one part the program we will populate the collection with some data, and then in another part of the program we will iterate over the data in that collection to process it in some way
